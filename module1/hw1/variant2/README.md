### Home work 1, variant 2

In this task I built my own framework.
First of all built module sustem (conteiner + injector) according to "Build your own AngularJS" book.
After that I built routing with help of 'crossroads' & 'hasher' libraries.
All development was performed under TDD process.

##### Plans for future:
In scope of home work 2 I will upload my framework to npm and will build application based on it.
